# B-Splines of degree 4

[B-Splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) are specialized parametric curves useful in curve-fitting, numerical differentiation of data, and in computer graphics applications. Their parameters are defined recursively so, in this essay, I obtain the explicit parameters for B-splines of degree up to and including 4.
